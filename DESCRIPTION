Description: 
    flowengineR is a modular and extensible framework for designing and executing 
    algorithmic workflows in R. It provides a standardized infrastructure to combine
    data-splitting, execution, preprocessing, core algorithms, in-processing, 
    post-processing, evaluation, reporting, and publishing using interchangeable 
    engine components.
    While applicable to a wide range of computational methods — including but not 
    limited to machine learning — the framework emphasizes transparency, reproducibility, 
    and user control across all stages of algorithm development.
    One core application domain is fairness-aware modeling: flowengineR includes 
    ready-to-use engines for implementing fairness interventions at various workflow stages.
    These can be freely combined with other engines or extended to support goals like 
    robustness, explainability, or domain-specific compliance.
    Its architecture supports custom engine development and encourages modular reuse 
    for research, prototyping, and production-grade analysis workflows.
