# --- Available Parameters for execution_basic_batchtools_multicore ---
# registry_folder: Character string path to batchtools registry directory.
# seed: Integer seed for reproducibility.
# ncpus: Integer number of parallel processes to run (recommended â‰¤ number of physical cores).
# required_packages: Character vector of R packages to preload in each worker.
#
# Notes:
# - This engine uses batchtools with `makeClusterFunctionsMulticore()`.
# - Only available on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, WSL). Not supported on Windows.
# - You can monitor progress via the batchtools registry located in `registry_folder`.
