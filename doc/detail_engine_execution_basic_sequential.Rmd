## Engine: Sequential Split Execution (`engine_execution_basic_sequential`)

### Purpose and Function
This engine executes the full training and evaluation workflow sequentially across all predefined data splits. It relies on the function `run_workflow_singlesplitloop()` and is ideal for debugging or when parallel execution is not needed or desired.

### Input Structure (via Wrapper)

**Standardized Inputs:**
- `control`: A list with the entire configuration structure for the workflow (⚠️ provided directly by the workflow).
- `split_output`: A list of data splits as created by the splitter engine (⚠️ provided directly by the workflow).
- `params`: Not used in this engine but passed through for consistency and potential future extensions.

### Engine-specific Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| –         | –    | –       | This engine does not use any parameters. |

### Output Structure

The wrapper returns a standardized list via `initialize_output_execution()` with the following structure:

- `execution_type`: `"basic_sequential"`
- `workflow_results`: List of outputs, one per split, as returned by `run_workflow_singlesplitloop()`.
- `params`: Parameters used (empty list).
- `continue_workflow`: Always `TRUE` for this engine.
- `specific_output`: List with:
    - `n_splits`: Number of executed splits

### Workflow Integration

- **Controller Function:** `controller_execution()`
- **Engine Wrapper:** `wrapper_execution_basic_sequential()`
- **Position in Flow:** Execution phase after splitting
- **Downstream Compatibility:** All subsequent stages (e.g., reporting) operate on the aggregated `workflow_results`.

### Template Reference

This engine's control template is located at:  
`inst/templates_control/2_1_a_template_control_execution_basic_sequential.R`

### Example Configuration
```r
control$engine_select$execution <- "execution_basic_sequential"
control$params$execution <- controller_execution(
  params = list()  # No parameters required
)
```
