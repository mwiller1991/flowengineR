Training Engines in `flowengineR` are responsible for fitting a predictive model to the (optionally preprocessed) training data. They define how a model is built and what output is returned for later evaluation and postprocessing steps.

## üì• Standardized Inputs (via Wrapper)
These inputs are passed to the engine wrapper and partially pre-filled by the framework:

| Input         | Type        | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `data`        | data.frame  | Original training dataset (‚ö†Ô∏è provided by the framework from split output) |
| `norm_data`   | logical     | Whether to apply normalization in the main workflow (user-defined switch from controller)  |
| `formula`     | formula     | Model formula used for training (from controller)                    |
| `params`      | list        | Additional engine-specific parameters (from controller)                   |

Framework resolution:
- `data`: provided by the framework (split output)
- `norm_data`: logical flag, passed via `control$params$train$norm_data`
- `formula`: passed via `control$params$train$formula`
- `params`: passed via `control$params$train$params`

## üì§ Standardized Output (via Wrapper)
Returned via `initialize_output_train()`:

| Output            | Type         | Description                                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `model`           | model object | Trained model object (e.g., caret model, lm object, etc.)                   |
| `model_type`      | character    | Short string indicating model type (e.g., "lm", "rf")                      |
| `formula`         | formula      | Model formula used                                                           |
| `predictions`     | vector       | Optional: fitted values or predictions on training set                      |
| `hyperparameters` | list / NULL  | Optional: hyperparameter values (if applicable)                             |
| `specific_output` | list / NULL  | Optional: engine-specific metadata                                          |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available Training Engines

| Engine Name  | Function Name                 | Description                      | Template Path                                                 | Detail Page |
|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `lm`         | `engine_train_lm()`           | Ordinary least squares regression | `inst/templates_control/4_a_template_control_train_lm.R`       | [üìÑ](detail_engine_train_lm.html) |
| `glm`         | `engine_train_glm()`           | Generalized linear models.       | `inst/templates_control/4_b_template_control_train_glm.R`     | [üìÑ](detail_engine_train_glm.html) |
| `gbm`        | `engine_train_gbm()`          | Gradient boosting models         | `inst/templates_control/4_c_template_control_train_gbm.R`      | [üìÑ](detail_engine_train_gbm.html) |

Use `list_registered_engines("train")` to inspect all currently loaded training engines.

## üß© Engine Usage in Workflow
To use a training engine, define it in the control object:

```r
control$engine_select$train <- "rf"
control$params$train <- controller_train(
  params = list(ntree = 500)
)
```

The engine is invoked automatically on each split during workflow execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Writing Your Own Training Engine

To implement a custom training engine:

1. Define an `engine_*()` function that performs model training.
2. Create a `wrapper_*()` function that manages parameters and output formatting.
3. Return results via `initialize_output_train()`.

For examples, see:
- `wrapper_train_lm()`
- `wrapper_train_glm()`
- `wrapper_train_gbm()`

## üîç Possible Use-Case: Benchmarking Algorithms

Training engines allow consistent benchmarking of different modeling approaches within the same preprocessing and evaluation pipeline. This is especially useful when testing multiple algorithms under controlled conditions, such as cross-validation or fairness-aware setups.

By separating model fitting into standardized training engines, it becomes easy to:
- Compare performance across different algorithms
- Evaluate robustness with respect to hyperparameters
- Integrate with postprocessing and evaluation modules

Example:
```r
control$engine_select$train <- "gbm"
control$params$train <- controller_train(
  params = list(n.trees = 200, interaction.depth = 3)
)
```

These capabilities make the training engine system a central component of the overall modular framework.
