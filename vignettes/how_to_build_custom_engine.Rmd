**Engine Development Guide: Creating Custom Engines in fairnessToolbox**

This guide explains the standardized structure required to build and register a new engine within the `fairnessToolbox` framework. All engines—whether for training, evaluation, fairness processing, reporting, or publishing—must follow the same core architectural pattern.

---

### Overview

Each custom engine must be implemented as **three distinct functions**:

1. `engine_<type>_<name>()`
   ➜ The core logic (model fitting, metric computation, transformation, etc.)

2. `wrapper_<type>_<name>()`
   ➜ The interface between the control object and the engine logic

3. `default_params_<type>_<name>()`
   ➜ The default hyperparameters for this engine (optional, but recommended)

These functions form a **minimal, complete engine definition**. If one is missing, the engine cannot be used.

---

### 1. Engine Function (`engine_*()`)

This is the pure computation layer. It contains **no validation**, **no logic related to the control object**, and **no standardization**.

#### Rules:

* Input arguments must be clean and explicit
* No assumptions about data preprocessing or training configuration
* Returns a raw output object (e.g., fitted model, metrics, or plots)

#### Example:

```r
engine_train_glm <- function(formula, family, data, sample_weight) {
  glm(formula = formula, family = family, data = data, weights = sample_weight)
}
```

---

### 2. Wrapper Function (`wrapper_*()`)

This function prepares inputs for the engine, validates user control, and constructs standardized outputs.

#### Responsibilities:

* Merge user-defined and default parameters (`merge_with_defaults()`)
* Validate presence of all required fields
* Optionally skip validation if `control$internal_skip_validation` is set
* Measure runtime or other metadata
* Return standardized output via `initialize_output_<type>()`

r
if (isTRUE(control\$internal\_skip\_validation)) {
return(list(skip\_validation = TRUE))
}

````

#### Example:
```r
wrapper_train_glm <- function(control) {
  train_data <- select_training_data(control$params$train$norm_data, control$params$train$data)
  hyperparameters <- merge_with_defaults(control$params$train$params, default_params_train_glm())
  model <- engine_train_glm(...)

  initialize_output_train(
    model = model,
    model_type = "glm",
    formula = control$params$train$formula,
    hyperparameters = hyperparameters,
    specific_output = list(training_time = ...)
  )
}
````

---

### 3. Default Parameter Function (`default_params_*()`)

Returns a named list of default values for engine-specific hyperparameters.

#### Guidelines:

* Should include all optional inputs that affect engine behavior
* Does not require user interaction
* Used only internally by the wrapper

#### Example:

```r
default_params_train_glm <- function() {
  list(
    sample_weight = NULL,
    family = gaussian()
  )
}
```

### Registration Convention

Before an engine can be used via the control object, it must first be registered in the global engine registry using the `register_engine()` function.

This function loads an external R script containing the three required components and validates their structure. It ensures full modularity and plug-in capability.

#### Automatic Validation During Registration

When you call `register_engine()`, a **type-specific validation function** is invoked based on the engine prefix (e.g., `train_`, `split_`, `eval_`). This function verifies:

* Wrapper signature (must match expected arguments)
* Correct use of the output initializer (e.g., `initialize_output_train()`)
* Functional behavior, where applicable (e.g., dummy predictions for eval engines)

**Validation can be skipped** during development. To do so, insert the following snippet **at the top of your wrapper function**:

```r
if (isTRUE(control$internal_skip_validation)) {
  return(list(skip_validation = TRUE))
}
```

This bypass mechanism is useful for meta-engines, prototypes, or non-functional test stubs.

#### Example: Registering a training engine file

```r
register_engine(
  engine_name = "train_glm",
  file_path = "engines/train/train_glm.R"
)
```

After registration, you can reference the engine by name in the control object:

)
```

After registration, you can reference the engine by name in the control object:
To use a custom engine in the fairnessToolbox workflow, only the **wrapper function needs to be referenced** in the control object. The engine and default functions are automatically picked up via naming conventions.

#### Example: Registering a training engine

```r
control$train <- "train_glm"  # This calls wrapper_train_glm()

control$params$train <- controller_training(
  formula = target ~ .,
  norm_data = TRUE,
  params = list(
    family = binomial(),
    sample_weight = rep(1, nrow(data))
  )
)
```

This setup is sufficient to execute the entire training phase using your custom engine trio.

* The name of the engine determines how it is referenced in the control object, e.g.:

```r
control$train <- "train_glm"  # matches wrapper_train_glm
```

* The wrapper is always registered by the user; engine and default function are used internally
