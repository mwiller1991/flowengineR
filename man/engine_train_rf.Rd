}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Model formula.}

\item{data}{Training data as data.frame.}

\item{sample_weight}{Numeric vector of observation weights.}

\item{ntree}{Number of trees to grow.}

\item{mtry}{Number of variables to sample at each split.}
}
\value{
A fitted model object of class \code{"randomForest"}.

\description{
Fits a random forest model based on the provided formula, data, and weights using the \code{randomForest} package.
}
\details{
\strong{Inputs (passed to engine via wrapper):}
\itemize{
\item \code{formula}: A formula specifying the model structure.
\item \code{data}: A data frame containing the training data (must include weights column if used).
\item \code{sample_weight}: A numeric vector of observation weights.
\item \code{ntree}: Number of trees to grow.
\item \code{mtry}: Number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split.
}

\strong{Output (returned to wrapper):}
\itemize{
\item A fitted model object of class \code{"randomForest"} as returned by \code{randomForest::randomForest()}.
