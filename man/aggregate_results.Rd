\title{Internal Helper: Aggregate Evaluation Metrics across Splits}
\usage{
aggregate_results(workflow_results)
}
\arguments{
\item{workflow_results}{A list of \code{run_workflow_single()} results (one per split).}
}
\value{
A named list of aggregated metrics, each containing summary statistics.
}
\description{
Aggregates both flat and nested evaluation metrics across multiple splits.
This function is used internally by the fairnessToolbox master workflow
to compute summary statistics from evaluation outputs.
}
\details{
\strong{Usage Context:}
\itemize{
\item Called by \code{continue_fairness_workflow()} during the aggregation phase.
\item Supports evaluation outputs with nested or flat metric structures.
}

\strong{Supported Formats:}
\itemize{
\item Flat metrics (e.g., \code{mse}, \code{stat_parity}) → numeric vector across splits.
\item Nested metrics (e.g., \code{summary_stats}) → submetric-level mean/sd.
}
