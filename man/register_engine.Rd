\title{Register an Engine in the flowengineR Framework}
\usage{
register_engine(engine_name, file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{engine_name}{Character. Name of the engine, e.g., \code{"train_lm"}.}

\item{file_path}{Character. Path to the R script that defines the engine components.}
}
\value{
Invisibly registers the engine into \code{flowengineR_env$engines[[engine_name]]} if valid.
}
\description{
Dynamically loads, validates, and registers a new engine into the global \code{engines} registry.
This function is a central building block of the \code{flowengineR} modular architecture, allowing
users to integrate custom engines for preprocessing, training, postprocessing, evaluation,
reporting, publishing, and execution.
}
\details{
\strong{Workflow:}
\enumerate{
\item Loads the engine file using \code{source()}.
\item Expects the file to contain:
\itemize{
\item \verb{wrapper_<engine_name>}: Standardized interface
\item \verb{engine_<engine_name>}: Core logic function
\item \verb{default_params_<engine_name>}: List of default hyperparameters
}
\item Calls a type-specific validation function, e.g., \code{validate_engine_train()}
\item If validation passes, the wrapper function is registered under \code{flowengineR_env$engines}
}

\strong{Supported Engine Types:}
\itemize{
\item \verb{split_*}: Data splitting engines
\item \verb{execution_*}: Workflow execution strategies (e.g., sequential, parallel)
\item \verb{preprocessing_*}: Data preprocessing before training
\item \verb{train_*}: Model training engines
\item \verb{inprocessing_*}: In-training modification engines
\item \verb{postprocessing_*}: Prediction adjustment after training
\item \verb{eval_*}: Evaluation engines (metrics, diagnostics)
\item \verb{report_*}: Report builders
\item \verb{reportelement_*}: Visual or tabular reporting components
\item \verb{publish_*}: Export engines for external output
}

\strong{Validation Mechanism:}
A centralized validation function (e.g., \code{validate_engine_train()}) is automatically
called based on the engine type. It checks structure, required arguments, return types,
and naming conventions.

\strong{Skipping Validation (Advanced Use):}
Wrappers can opt out of validation (e.g., during prototyping) by returning
\code{list(skip_validation = TRUE)} during test execution.

\strong{Example:}

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{register_engine(
  engine_name = "train_customtree",
  file_path = "engines/train/train_customtree.R"
)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}
