\title{Internal Stability Strategy: Coefficient of Variation (Relative Difference)}
\usage{
check_stability_cv_relative(values, threshold, window, fun = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{Numeric vector. Metric values collected across iterations.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Maximum allowed relative difference.}

\item{window}{Integer. Number of trailing values to include in the window.}

\item{fun}{Ignored. Reserved for interface consistency across strategies.}
}
\value{
A named list:
\itemize{
\item \code{is_stable}: Logical. TRUE if relative CV difference is below \code{threshold}.
\item \code{stability_value}: Computed relative CV difference.
\item \code{threshold_value}: The threshold provided as input.
\item \code{strategy}: Fixed string \code{"cv_relative"}.
}
}
\description{
Evaluates whether the variability relative to the mean (CV = sd/mean)
remains stable over time. Compares the CV of all metric values with
the CV of the most recent subset.
}
\details{
\strong{Stability Rule:}
\itemize{
\item Compute the CV of the full vector: \code{cv_global = sd / mean}.
\item Compute the CV of the trailing window: \code{cv_window = sd / mean}.
\item Calculate the relative difference between both CVs.
\item If this difference is below \code{threshold}, stability is achieved.
}

\strong{Use Case:}
\itemize{
\item Suitable for metrics where both mean and variability matter.
}

\strong{Notes:}
\itemize{
\item The \code{fun} argument is ignored; included for interface consistency.
