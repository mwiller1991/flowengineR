\title{Internal Stability Strategy: Standard Deviation (Relative Difference)}
\usage{
check_stability_sd_relative(values, threshold, window, fun = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{Numeric vector. Metric values collected across iterations.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Maximum allowed relative SD difference.}

\item{window}{Integer. Number of trailing values to include in the moving window.}

\item{fun}{Ignored. Reserved for strategy interface consistency.}
}
\value{
A named list:
\itemize{
\item \code{is_stable}: Logical. TRUE if relative SD difference is below \code{threshold}.
\item \code{stability_value}: Computed relative difference.
\item \code{threshold_value}: The threshold provided as input.
\item \code{strategy}: Fixed string \code{"sd_relative"}.
}
}
\description{
Evaluates the relative change in variability over time by comparing the standard deviation
of all observed metric values with the standard deviation of the most recent \code{window} values.
}
\details{
\strong{Stability Rule:}
\itemize{
\item Compute the standard deviation (SD) of the full metric vector.
\item Compute the SD of the last \code{window} values.
\item Calculate the relative difference between both values.
\item If the relative difference is below \code{threshold}, stability is reached.
}

\strong{Use Case:}
\itemize{
\item Good for identifying when variance in the metric stabilizes around a consistent level.
}

\strong{Notes:}
\itemize{
\item The \code{fun} argument is ignored and only present for compatibility.
