\title{Run the Initial Fairness Workflow (Preparation and Execution Phase)}
\usage{
fairness_workflow(control)
}
\arguments{
\item{control}{A standardized list structure containing all workflow instructions and parameters. Created manually or via controller functions.}
}
\value{
A structured list containing at least \code{split_output} and \code{execution_output}. Additional elements may be included depending on the workflow stage.
}
\description{
This function initiates a full fairness-aware machine learning workflow by handling the preparation phase.
It calls the specified splitter engine to create data partitions and passes the result to the chosen execution engine.
Depending on the execution setup, the function may return early (e.g. if a batchtools-based external execution such as SLURM is used),
or directly continue with downstream processing via \code{continue_fairness_workflow()}.
}
\details{
\strong{Inputs:}
\itemize{
\item \code{control}: A standardized control object. This must contain all relevant components for the workflow:
\itemize{
\item \code{split_method}: Name of a registered splitter engine (e.g. \code{"split_random_stratified"})
\item \code{execution}: Name of a registered execution engine (optional; defaults to \code{"execution_sequential"})
\item \code{params}: Parameter structure used by downstream engines (e.g., split ratio, seeds, evaluation metrics)
}
}

\strong{Output:}
\itemize{
\item If the execution engine returns early (e.g. external execution), the function returns a partial result with:
\itemize{
\item \code{split_output}: Result of the splitting process
\item \code{execution_output}: Result of the execution engine
\item \code{aggregated_results}, \code{reportelements}, \code{reports}, \code{publishing}: All \code{NULL}
}
\item If the execution continues within the R session, the function delegates to \code{continue_fairness_workflow()} and returns:
\itemize{
\item Full structured workflow result, including post-execution outputs
}
}

\strong{Usage Context:}
\itemize{
\item This is the main entry point into the framework.
\item It is intended to be called by users who wish to run training, (optional) fairness pre-/in-/post-processing, evaluation, reporting, and publishing in a single pipeline.
