\title{Continue the Workflow after Execution Phase}
\usage{
continue_workflow(control, split_output, execution_output)
}
\arguments{
\item{control}{A standardized list that controls the reporting and publishing steps.}

\item{split_output}{The result of the splitting engine, required for contextual reports.}

\item{execution_output}{A valid result from an execution engine, including \code{workflow_results}.}
}
\value{
A named list containing the full workflow results, including aggregation, reports and published outputs.
}
\description{
This function completes a modular workflow by performing post-execution steps:
\itemize{
\item Aggregates the raw results from multiple workflow runs,
\item Optionally generates reporting elements and full reports using registered reporting engines,
\item Optionally calls publishing engines to export final results to external formats.
}
}
\details{
\strong{Inputs:}
\itemize{
\item \code{control}: A standardized control object. Must contain instructions for reporting and publishing if applicable.
\item \code{split_output}: The output from the splitting engine, used for report contextualization.
\item \code{execution_output}: Output returned from the execution engine, including raw workflow results.
}

\strong{Output:}
\itemize{
\item A named list with all downstream results:
\itemize{
\item \code{split_output}: Returned as passed.
\item \code{execution_output}: Returned as passed.
\item \code{aggregated_results}: Aggregated evaluation metrics across splits.
\item \code{reportelements}: Optional list of individual reporting element outputs (if specified).
\item \code{reports}: Optional list of final reports (if specified).
\item \code{publishing}: Optional list of results from publishing engines (if specified).
}
}

\strong{Usage Context:}
\itemize{
\item Automatically called within \code{run_workflow()} unless the execution engine is configured to terminate early.
\item May also be called manually (e.g., from \code{resume_workflow()}) to finalize an externally executed pipeline.
}
}
