\title{Internal Stability Strategy: Coefficient of Variation (Absolute Difference)}
\usage{
check_stability_cv_absolute(values, threshold, window, fun = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{Numeric vector. Metric values collected across iterations.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Maximum allowed absolute difference.}

\item{window}{Integer. Number of trailing values to include in the window.}

\item{fun}{Ignored. Included for consistent interface across strategies.}
}
\value{
A named list:
\itemize{
\item \code{is_stable}: Logical. Indicates if stability is achieved.
\item \code{stability_value}: Computed absolute CV difference.
\item \code{threshold_value}: The threshold provided as input.
\item \code{strategy}: Fixed string \code{"cv_absolute"}.
}
}
\description{
Evaluates whether the coefficient of variation (CV = sd/mean) has stabilized
by comparing the absolute difference between the full vector and the trailing window.
}
\details{
\strong{Stability Rule:}
\itemize{
\item Compute CV of the full vector: \code{cv_global = sd(values) / mean(values)}
\item Compute CV of the last \code{window} values: \code{cv_window = sd(tail(values, window)) / mean(tail(values, window))}
\item If \verb{|cv_window - cv_global| < threshold}, stability is reached.
}

\strong{Use Case:}
\itemize{
\item Suitable when both dispersion and scale must be monitored jointly.
}

\strong{Notes:}
\itemize{
\item \code{fun} argument is ignored; included for signature consistency.
